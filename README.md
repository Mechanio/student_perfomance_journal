# student_perfomance_journal
Python project of student perfomance journal.

This is my course work for university. The main idea of this project is to create perfomance journal using SQL database.

Python 3.2
SQL used in this project - SQLite 3.33.0
Libraries: Tkinter

To run this project you need to create a new project and add these 3 files.

At first you need to create database tables from file "create_databases.py", then You need to create some teachers and students via SQLite browser and run this project from file "authorization.py".

This project has a great opportunities in improvement such as: Admin frame, Registration via admin frame, calculation of average grade, tabs for one subject in teacher's window, erase limit of subjects for one teacher and groups for one subject...
